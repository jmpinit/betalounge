==========

A Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) for students to learn how computers work. Based on the Computational Structures class at MIT (6.004).

Features
--------

* Top-down 2 dimensional ASCII art world.
* Inventory system for:
	* Circuit parts
	* Floppy discs
* Chat system, so students can talk to one another.
* Network of [Beta](http://6004.mit.edu/currentsemester/handouts/beta.pdf) RISC processor emulations.
	* Keyboard
	* Monitor - basic ASCII character display
	* Floppy Drive - share programs with other students
* Breadboards for very basic CMOS circuit emulation. Full implementation of Beta possible.

Origin
------

Me being in the Computational Structures class (6.004) MIT and wanting a big project to learn the material.
